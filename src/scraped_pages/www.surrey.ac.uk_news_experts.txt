He has given talks and hosted seminars and workshops with academic, practitioner, commercial and public audiences across the UK and Europe, and in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and USA. As of December 2024, his work has been cited over 16,000 times, including in more than 200 policy documents.Prof Gardner is founder and co-Director of theHabit Application and Theory group, and co-Lead of theSustainability through Behaviour Change research programmeat the University of Surrey Institute for Sustainability. He is co-Lead of theEuropean Health Psychology Society Habit Special Interest Group. He holds editorial board positions atHealth Psychology ReviewandSocial Science & Medicine, and is a Consultant atBritish Journal of Health Psychology.Prof Gardner's research relates to psychological processes that affect all behaviours. Nonetheless, the main behaviours that he has focused on to date have been health (e.g., sedentary behaviour and sitting, physical activity, dietary consumption) and environmentally relevant actions (e.g., travel mode choice). He has led funded research projects to develop novel habit-based interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in office workers and older adults, and contributed habit and behaviour change expertise to funded work (e.g. MRC, NIHR) supporting health promotion among older adults, office workers, parents and children.

As of December 2024, his work has been cited over 16,000 times, including in more than 200 policy documents.

Prof Gardner is founder and co-Director of theHabit Application and Theory group, and co-Lead of theSustainability through Behaviour Change research programmeat the University of Surrey Institute for Sustainability. He is co-Lead of theEuropean Health Psychology Society Habit Special Interest Group. He holds editorial board positions atHealth Psychology ReviewandSocial Science & Medicine, and is a Consultant atBritish Journal of Health Psychology.

Prof Gardner's research relates to psychological processes that affect all behaviours. Nonetheless, the main behaviours that he has focused on to date have been health (e.g., sedentary behaviour and sitting, physical activity, dietary consumption) and environmentally relevant actions (e.g., travel mode choice). He has led funded research projects to develop novel habit-based interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in office workers and older adults, and contributed habit and behaviour change expertise to funded work (e.g. MRC, NIHR) supporting health promotion among older adults, office workers, parents and children.
